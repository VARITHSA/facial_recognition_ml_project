# 🎭 Facial Recognition ML Project

Welcome to the **Facial Recognition ML Project**! 🚀 This project leverages deep learning techniques to recognize and classify human faces in real-time. It utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to extract features and classify emotions or identities based on the provided dataset.

## 📌 Features
✅ **Real-time Face Detection** using OpenCV 📷  
✅ **Deep Learning Model** built with TensorFlow/Keras 🧠  
✅ **Multi-Class Facial Recognition** (identity/emotion classification) 🎭  
✅ **Preprocessing & Augmentation** to improve model performance 📊  
✅ **User-friendly Implementation** with step-by-step guidance 📝
